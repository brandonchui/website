# How I Made A Coffee Shop Game

Overcooked inspired this game prototype. The objective of the game is to prepare meals for customers. I made a similar mechanic, but only for drinks. I also added a way for you to kick customers out if the order is too complicated—though there is a penalty if you do that. My game also differs as I added customer types—regular and impatient.

## Handholding
In a video game, handholding refers to a game forcing or suggesting you to do an action. It is most commonly seen in a tutorial, where the player must follow concrete instructions to proceed. This handholding mechanic could be non-existent in other games, and the player must discover everything themselves. I implemented a tutorial for this game where I forced the player to create a food item. The game also has tooltips explaining what everything does when you hover over an object.

## Quality of Life
Visual feedback is crucial since you want to let the user know when an action occurred. A basic example is a button where a shadow appears when you click on it so you see an action took place. In my game, I added various animations after performing such actions so you know the action succeeded. Some examples are smoking appearing when using a coffee machine and the sound of clinking mugs when you pick up a cup. In addition, the character has to be near an appliance to interact with it, and I implemented an outer highlight around the appliance to let the user know that an action can be performed now.

## Lessons Learned
The game felt very little to the imagination and quickly became repetitive after playtesting. Overall, this game was feature-packed in a tiny package - though probably veering on the side of over-engineering.
